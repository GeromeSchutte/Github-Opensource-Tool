# Github Opensource Tool

As a developer, you’ve heard about open source projects. Visual Studio Code, Android, and various linux distributions are examples of high impact open source projects in the wild. Maybe you’ve thought about contributing to one of these, maybe to learn, to add something to your CV, or because you appreciate the project and want to give back, and you open the git repo, only to find that it’s written in a language you don’t know much about, or there aren’t any open issues you can work on.
<br/><br/>I’ve had this exact problem, and that is why I’d like to build a tool to help.

## Getting Started

- Ensure yarn is installed: `yarn -v`
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Build and run app in live reload mode: `yarn start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
